# 3D Ball App

This project is a simple web application that showcases a 3D ball using the Three.js library. The ball can be interactively rotated by clicking and holding the mouse. The project also demonstrates the use of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for timeline-based animations and OrbitControls for camera manipulation.

## Demo

## Features

- 3D Ball rendering using Three.js.
- Interactivity: Click and hold the mouse to rotate the ball.
- Smooth animations with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
- Camera manipulation with OrbitControls.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/TechTronixx/3D-Ball-3js
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd 3d-ball-app`

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   `npm install`

   or

   `yarn`

4. Start the development server with Vite:

   `npm run dev`

   or

   `yarn dev`

5. Open your web browser and visit the local development URL provided by Vite. Typically, it will be something like `http://localhost:3000/`.

Now you should be able to see and interact with the 3D ball application locally using Vite's development server.

## Tech Used

The project uses the following technologies:

- Three.js - A popular JavaScript 3D library for rendering 3D objects in the browser.
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) - A powerful animation library for smooth and precise animations.
- Vite - A fast and lightweight development server.
- OrbitControls - A popular Three.js library for camera manipulation.
